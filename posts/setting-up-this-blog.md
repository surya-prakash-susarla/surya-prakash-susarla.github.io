# Setting Up This Blog: A Journey with 11ty

Welcome to my new personal blog! This inaugural post details the exciting process of setting up this very site using [Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/), a lightweight static site generator.

## The Vision

My goal was to create a clean, professional, and fast personal blog. I envisioned a layout with a prominent title, a subtle separator, a left-hand navigation pane for posts, and a main content area. Both the navigation and content areas needed to be independently scrollable for a smooth user experience.

## Initial Setup

We started by initializing an `npm` project and installing 11ty. The project was configured to output to a `docs` folder, ideal for [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) deployment. Essential `npm` scripts were added for local development (`npm start`) and building the site (`npm run build`).

## Crafting the Layout and Style

The core layout was built using HTML and CSS, leveraging CSS Grid for the two-column structure. We opted for a low-profile aesthetic with an off-white background (`#f5f5f5`) and a professional sans-serif font. A subtle separator was added between the navigation and main content areas to enhance visual clarity. The left navigation bar's width was carefully adjusted to ensure a balanced look.

## Populating the Content

An "About" page was created as the default landing content, providing a concise introduction and links to my professional profiles. The content for this page was thoughtfully extracted and refined from my existing landing page, ensuring consistency and a personal touch.

## What's Next?

This setup provides a robust foundation for sharing my thoughts on technology, software development, and personal interests. I'm excited to start populating this space with more posts and insights. Stay tuned!
