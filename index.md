Hello! I'm Surya Susarla, a software engineer at AWS specializing in backend services and Gen AI. I'm passionate about building scalable, high-performance systems and contributing to open source. My interests also extend to the AI space, where I explore creating utilities to enhance software services. I hold a Master's in Computer Science from North Carolina State University and previously worked at Microsoft on the Edge browser.

Outside of work, I'm an avid gamer, enjoying simulators, single-player, and sports titles. I also love road trips and driving.

Feel free to connect with me for collaborations or opportunities.
