      <h1>Setting Up This Blog: A Journey with 11ty</h1>
<p>Welcome to my new personal blog! This inaugural post details the exciting process of setting up this very site using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy (11ty)</a>, a lightweight static site generator.</p>
<h2>The Vision</h2>
<p>My goal was to create a clean, professional, and fast personal blog. I envisioned a layout with a prominent title, a subtle separator, a left-hand navigation pane for posts, and a main content area. Both the navigation and content areas needed to be independently scrollable for a smooth user experience.</p>
<h2>Initial Setup</h2>
<p>We started by initializing an <code>npm</code> project and installing 11ty. The project was configured to output to a <code>docs</code> folder, ideal for <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> deployment. Essential <code>npm</code> scripts were added for local development (<code>npm start</code>) and building the site (<code>npm run build</code>).</p>
<h2>Crafting the Layout and Style</h2>
<p>The core layout was built using HTML and CSS, leveraging CSS Grid for the two-column structure. We opted for a low-profile aesthetic with an off-white background (<code>#f5f5f5</code>) and a professional sans-serif font. A subtle separator was added between the navigation and main content areas to enhance visual clarity. The left navigation bar's width was carefully adjusted to ensure a balanced look.</p>
<h2>Populating the Content</h2>
<p>An &quot;About&quot; page was created as the default landing content, providing a concise introduction and links to my professional profiles. The content for this page was thoughtfully extracted and refined from my existing landing page, ensuring consistency and a personal touch.</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>This setup provides a robust foundation for sharing my thoughts on technology, software development, and personal interests. I'm excited to start populating this space with more posts and insights. Stay tuned!</p>
